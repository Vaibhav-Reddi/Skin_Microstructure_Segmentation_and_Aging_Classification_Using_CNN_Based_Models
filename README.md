The project aim is to study the appearance of hand wrinkles using deep CNN, which is 
considered as  one of the most noticeable changes that happen as people become older. 
We perform skin microstructure segmentation and aging analysis by using Convolutional 
Neural Network (CNN) models using MatLab
